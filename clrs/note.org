#+title: CLRS Algorithm Learning


*  Leture 1

** Analysis of Algorithm

** Insert Sort

** Asymptotic Analysis

** Merge Sort

* Leture 2 

** Asymptotic Notation

*** Big O notation
The upper bound.  
   
*** Omega notation
The Lower bound

*** Theta notation
The tight bounds
   
*** little-o  and little-omega notation
Unlike Big O and Big-omega notation which are  less or equal than and bigger or equal than,

little-o and little-omega are just less than and bigger than.

** Recurrences

*** Substitution method
General method:
1. Guss the form of the solution
2. Verity by induction
3. Solve for constants

*** Iterating the recurrence

*** Recursion tree

*** Master Method

     

* TopCoder Practice

** Sort Problem
