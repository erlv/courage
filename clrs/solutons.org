    - multi sources => single source 
      A flow in multi source is  a flow that from a source in the graph, to a sink of the graph.
      For the equivalent single-source, we can just extend the flow so that it come from the supersource and goto the supersink.
      As the capacity from the supersource to the real source, and the capacity from the sink to the supersink are all infinite.
      A flow in multi source is identical in single-source flow netwok.
    - single source =>multi sources
      Because the edges connect the supersource are all connect to a source in the multi-sources flow network, so is the edge from sink to supersink.
      Any flow from the supersource to the supersink will only goto one source and one sink, for the source and sink, it is an identical flow.
