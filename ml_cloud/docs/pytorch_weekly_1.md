# Pytorch Weekly - #1, May 2nd 2023

Welcome to the 1st issue of Pytorch Weekly, a weekly newsletter covering development in Pytorch AI development platform.

## News and articles from around the web and events

- [Hidet](https://pytorch.org/blog/introducing-hidet/) is introduced on `PyTorch` blog as a deep learning compiler for Efficient Model serving.  `Triton` and `Hidet Script` both allow tensor program developers can easily handle the tile-based programming model.While, compared to `Triton`, `Hidet Script` simplifies tensor programming by handling the fine-grained computation and memory resources (e.g., warps, shared memory) manipulation.

- [TorchBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14226) is introduced by `Yueming Hao` and other guys from `Meta Platforms, Inc`. `TorchBench` is a novel benchmark suite to study the performance of `PyTorch` software stack and has been used to identify the GPU performance inefficiencies in PyTorch, and it has also been integrated into the PyTorch continuous integration system.

- Towards Data Science published an amazing article: [Build your own Transformer from scratch using Pytorch](https://towardsdatascience.com/build-your-own-transformer-from-scratch-using-pytorch-84c850470dcb) writen by Arjun Sarkar. It teaches the reader to build a transformer model step by step in PyTorch.

- The recent `PyTorch 2.0 Ask the Engineers Q&A Series` brought `TorchRL` by [Vincent Moens](https://github.com/vmoens/) and [Shashank Prasanna](https://shashankprasanna.com/) from `Meta`.

- [Zachary DeVito](https://cs.stanford.edu/~zdevito/) contribute to the Pytorch Forum about  [Fast combined C++/Python/TorchScript/Inductor tracebacks](https://dev-discuss.pytorch.org/t/fast-combined-c-python-torchscript-inductor-tracebacks/1158/2)

- [David Stutz](https://github.com/davidstutz) proposed a way for [Loading and Saving PyTorch Models Without Knowing the Architecture in Advance](https://davidstutz.de/loading-and-saving-pytorch-models-without-knowing-the-architecture/)

- Want to check the differences between `PyTorch` and `Jax`, check [JAX vs. PyTorch: Differences and Similarities [2023]](https://geekflare.com/jax-vs-pytorch/)
